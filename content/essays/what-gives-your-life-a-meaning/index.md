What gives your life a meaning? God . Love . Money. Football. Game of Thrones?

You might have your own personal sense of purpose in your life, or you might
believe that you were created with a certain essence as a human being, with a
purpose given to you by God or maybe you don’t know.

But the real thing is that, the sense of meaning is something that we all crave
for. We devote a lot of time and energy to this task of finding meaning in life.

You are not alone. There are some philosophers and thinkers who have devoted
their entire life to this topic. Let us take a look at some of their ideas.

## Essentialism

Way back in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle took it as, given that
everything has an essence — a certain set of core properties that are necessary,
or essential — for a thing to be what it is. If those properties were missing,
then that thing would be a different thing.

For instance, a knife could have a wooden handle or a metal handle — it really
doesn’t matter. But if it didn’t have a blade, it wouldn’t really be a knife
anymore. The **blade** is the essential property of the knife, because it gives
the knife its defining function.

Now, Plato and Aristotle thought that everything has an essence — including us.
And they believed that our essences exist in us before we’re even born. So by
this thinking, part of what it means to be a good human is to adhere to your
essence.

It does not matter if you are good at your essence or bad at it, but you were
born to do that certain thing. This belief is known as
[essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism), and it was the
standard view of the world uptill the late 19th century and still accepted by
many today.

Then came in **[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche), a German
philosopher**.

> “What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger” —
> Nietzsche

He is said to be the father of
“[Nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism)”, which means nothingness.

## Existential nihilism

It is the [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) theory that
[life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) has no intrinsic
[meaning](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(existential)>) or
[value](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics)>). With respect to the
universe, existential nihilism puts that a single human or even the entire human
species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality
of existence.

A lot of people find Nihilism negative and suffer from existential dread and are
generally feared by the idea of having a meaningless life. But this is because
they don’t understand its philosophy. Nihilism can be optimistic and its just a
matter of perspective. More on this later.

## Existentialism

By the mid-20th century, the path had been paved for French thinker
**Jean-Paul Sartre** to return to the question of essence and ask:

What if we exist first?

What if we’re born without any hard-wired purpose?

And then it’s up to us to find our own essences? Well this became the framework
for what we now know as
[existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism).

> **“existence precedes essence.”**

In other words, our existence — our birth — happens first. Then, it’s up to each
of us to determine who we are. We have to write our own essence, through the way
we choose to live. But we have no actual, predetermined purpose — there’s no set
path that we’re supposed to follow.

## Absurdism

In the 20th century the French philosopher and novelist [Albert
Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) came up with the idea of
[Absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism). He said we are creatures
who need meaning, but we’re abandoned in a universe full of meaninglessness. So
we cry into the wilderness, and get no response. But we keep crying anyway.
That, for an **existentialist**, is the definition of **absurd**.

He quoted :

> “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.
> Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the
> fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest — whether or not the world has
> three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories — comes
> afterwards. These are games; one must first answer.”

Absurdism gives you three choice :

1. Turn to nihilism and live a life of despair until eventually taking your own
   life.

2. Commit an intellectual suicide by turning to religion and simply ignoring
   life’s meaninglessness and inventing a god to fill that void.

3. Accepting that life is meaningless and, in an act of absurdity, choose to
   live a life passionately, choosing things that you can be passionate about and
   following those things.

Absurdism advocates that you take option third.

But Sartre faced meaninglessness head-on, and explored one of the most agonizing
aspects of existentialism.

Not the world’s lack of meaning. But its terrifying abundance of freedom. To
most of us, freedom sounds pretty great. But Sartre thought that we are
painfully, shockingly free. After all, if there are no guidelines for our
actions, then each of us is forced to design our own moral code, to invent a
morality to live by.

Sartre took this to mean that we are “_condemned to be free,_” a fate that he
found to be quite awful. You might think that there’s some authority you could
look to for answers, Sartre said, but all of the authorities you can think of
are fake. Sartre said those authorities are really just people like you, people
who don’t have any answers, people who had to figure out for themselves how to
live. So the best thing you can really do, he determined, is to live
authentically.

> _“In life man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there
> is nothing. No doubt this thought may seem harsh to someone who has not made a
> success of his life. But on the other hand, it helps people to understand that
> reality alone counts, and that dreams, expectations and hopes only serve to
> define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations._” —
> **Sartre**

#### Update [Edit -2]

## Optimistic Nihilism

You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free. If the
universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be
forgotten. Every mistake you made will not matter in the end. Every bad thing
you did will be voided. If our life is all we get to experience, then it’s the
only thing that matters. If the universe has no principles, the only principles
relevant are the ones we decide on. If the universe has no purpose, then we get
to dictate what its purpose is. Humans will most certainly cease to exist at
some point, but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around
us. We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises,
and being with each other. The fact that we’re even able to think about these
things is already kind of incredible. We are truly free in a universe-sized
playground, so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia
in the stars. It’s not as if we’ve found out everything there is to know We
don’t know why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into
existence, what life is. We have no idea what consciousness is or if we are
alone in the universe. But we can try to find some answers. There are billions
of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help, happy feelings to be
experienced, and video games to finish. There is so much to do. So, wrapping up,
you’ve probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you.If this is our
one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and live as happy as
possible. Bonus points if you made the life of other people better. More bonus
points if you help build a galactic human empire. Do the things that make you
feel good. You get to decide whatever this means for you.
